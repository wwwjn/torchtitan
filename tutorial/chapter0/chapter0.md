# Chapter 0: Transformer, Llama

In this chapter, you will learn about the basic Transformer architecture, and train a simple Transformer model **on a single GPU** without parallelism. This will serve as a foundation for the rest of the tutorial, and we will gradually adding more parallelism technics on top of it.

We will use Llama3.1-8b model as an example.

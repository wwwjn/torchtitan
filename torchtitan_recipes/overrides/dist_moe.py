"""Dist-MoE routed experts for one actor's model config, e.g. only the RL trainer.

The RL trainer and generator share one ``model_config``. ``DistMoeTransform``
rewrites that shared config, so the vLLM generator would also receive Dist-MoE
experts. This override applies the same replacement to the copy owned by the
actor that lists it::

    trainer.override = OverrideConfig(
        imports=["torchtitan_recipes.overrides.dist_moe.dist_moe_routed_experts"]
    )
    trainer.dist_moe = DistMoeRuntime.Config(device_scratch_capacity_factor=4.0)

The generator keeps the stock ``RoutedExperts``. Checkpoint and weight-sync keys
do not change.

"""Run the GDN (Gated DeltaNet) generation layer on TorchTitan's own FLA kernels.

Motivation: the vLLM-native Qwen3.5 generation path runs vLLM's vendored FLA GDN
kernels, while the trainer runs the standalone ``fla`` package (see
``torchtitan/models/qwen3_5/model.py``). Two different implementations of the
same recurrence is a source of train/infer logprob drift. This module swaps ONLY
the GDN linear-attention layer's recurrence to the SAME ``fla`` ops the trainer
uses, while reusing all of vLLM's hybrid machinery (paged conv/ssm state cache,
GDN attention metadata, weight loading). Everything else (full attention, MoE,
projections) stays vLLM-native.

Mechanism: vLLM's ``QwenGatedDeltaNetAttention`` is a ``PluggableLayer``, so we
register an out-of-tree subclass under its name; vLLM then instantiates ours
wherever it would build the native layer. We override only ``_forward_core`` --
the conv + recurrence numeric core -- and keep the native ``__init__`` (params,
projections, cache spec) unchanged.

Scope: non-speculative decoding only (asserts otherwise). Requires the generator
cudagraph to be disabled (the generator hook forces this when enabled).

Opt-in via env ``TT_GDN_UNIFIED_KERNEL=1`` (default off -> vLLM-native, easy
fallback). Call ``register_titan_gdn()`` before the vLLM engine is built.

class RolloutGroupWorkBuffer(Configurable):
    """Run-ahead buffer of RolloutGroupWork shared by the data-input, rollout, and batcher loops.

    Each entry is a RolloutGroupWork moving WAITING -> INFLIGHT -> FINALIZED. An active-slot budget caps
    run-ahead at `max_active_rollout_groups` active slots; the batcher takes ANY finalized group in
    completion order (take-any), skipping still-INFLIGHT stragglers, so a slow head does not stall it.

    For details on the buffer's callers, check the diagram in the controller.py file.

    NOTE: a work slot is **NOT** released when marked as FINALIZED or taken by the batcher.
    Instead, it is only released on `release_active_groups` calls by the trainer
    or data filtering. This is done this way so that we can guarantee we never have more
    than `max_active_rollout_groups` in the entire pipeline (buffer+queue+training).
    Otherwise, we would produce born-stale examples.

    Entry lifecycle vs active slot:
        entry:        WAITING -> INFLIGHT -> FINALIZED -> removed by take_finalized()
        active slot:  charged by add_work() ............ freed by release_active_groups()

        # max_offpolicy_steps=1, num_groups_per_train_step=2 -> capacity=4
        await buffer.add_work(g0); await buffer.add_work(g1)   # 2/4 active
